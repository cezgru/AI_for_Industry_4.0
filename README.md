# AI_for_Industry_4.0
This project was created as a solution to a recruitment task. It contains a model used for predicting characteristing of fibre optic sensors in different enviroments based on measurements done in air.

Task: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WGQ8H6_l07yqe1JIQC1hQ6RWutZqqJbn/view

## Input
The input is a file containing wavelengths and amplitudes, in this order. These should represent a sensors measured characteristics in air.

## Usage 
Load the desired model in a ipynb and use it's .predict(X) on a compatible dataset. Save results as needed.
